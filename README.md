# Kotlin asserts comparison

This repo contains several typical tests implemented with different asserts libraries:
1. [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
2. [kotlin.test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/)
3. [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/)
4. [Kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest)
5. [Truth](https://truth.dev/)
6. [Ham—Årest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/)

* [Kluent](https://markusamshove.github.io/Kluent/)
* [Atrium](https://github.com/robstoll/atrium)
* [Expekt](https://github.com/winterbe/expekt)
* [AssertK](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/assertk)
* [HamKrest](https://github.com/npryce/hamkrest)

Also [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org) is used in a different folder.

The goal of this project is to provide a starting point for choosing asserts library for a Kotlin project. It can be considered as a mini Rosetta stone.
